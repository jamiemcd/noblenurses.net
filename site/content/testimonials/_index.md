    quote: >-
      I was an ADN RN stagnant in my career when I met Christopher Noble.
      He encouraged and coached me through BSN and MSN, PCCN,
      EKG/telemetry, and professional role development. Let Chris be your
      professional educator for all of your healthcare needs, you will succeed!
  - author: Donna Mills, BSN, RN
    quote: >-
      Certifications such as ACLS, BLS, or a mandatory EKG test can be stressful
      regardless of how many times one has taken them. Chris Noble has helped
      me many times with one-on-one instruction. Afterwards, I was not only
      better prepared, but also felt less stressed and had more confidence to
      take on the challenge.

    quote: >-
      Chris was very professional, courteous, and accommodating! Having three
      little children and a busy work life, my time is precious. Chris made the
      process very easy and quick!
  - author: Mandie Zachem, MSN, APRN, RN
    quote: >-
      Chris has inspired me with his zeal for education. He works hard to make
      education a priority in his career and in the nurse’s careers he works
      with and around.  Chris has a heart and a knack for nursing education.
  - author: Heather Morton, MSN, RN, MSRN
    quote: >-
      Nursing truly is a wonderful profession. We have more opportunities than
      most professions. With opportunities comes transition and sometimes
      beginning the transition can be overwhelming. I have had several
      transitions in my almost 10 years as a nurse. I am thankful and blessed to
      have Chris Noble as a mentor whom I have leaned on more than once. Chris
      has helped me, better yet, he believes in me. When my light starts to dim,
      he provides the support and encouragement I need to re-engage. I have seen
      Chris provide the same compassion and enthusiasm to others that have
      crossed Chris’s path. He wants to see others succeed and will help in
      anyway possible. Chris loves nurses and his knowledge and dedication to
      the profession is undeniable. I can count on Chris 100% of the time to
      help guide in through whatever dilemma I may be having.

      Christopher is the definition of a fantastic professional nurse and
      educator. He has helped me so much during my career and educational
      advancement. He has been the ultimate mentor by guiding me in the right
      direction, helping me clarify ideas, and put evidence based practice into
      motion.
  - author: Meredith McDaniel
    quote: >-
      Chris was instrumental in helping me be able to understand the care planning
      process. I was struggling with getting "needs improvement" so I reached out
      to Chris to ask for his help. After one session with him, I was able to
      understand what was expected to be written into a care plan and the
      rationales behind them. I then started receiving "excellent" comments on my
      submissions. Thanks, Chris!
