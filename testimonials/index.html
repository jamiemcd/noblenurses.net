With opportunities comes transition and sometimes beginning the transition can be overwhelming. I have had several transitions in my almost 10 years as a nurse. I am thankful and blessed to have Chris Noble as a mentor whom I have leaned on more than once. Chris has helped me, better yet, he believes in me. When my light starts to dim, he provides the support and encouragement I need to re-engage. I have seen Chris provide the same compassion and enthusiasm to others that have crossed Chris’s path. He wants to see others succeed and will help in anyway possible. Chris loves nurses and his knowledge and dedication to the profession is undeniable.
